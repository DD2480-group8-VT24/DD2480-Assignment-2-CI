# how to run the server
- make sure to have java openjdk 21 installed, since that is the java version used for the project
- make sure you have installed ngrok and set it up on your machine, use following [link](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/)
- make sure you have installed latest version of maven, you can use the following [link](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Strongly advise to use intellij idea as the your IDE since that makes everything easier.
  
- clone the repo and make sure you are inside the CI subfolder
- now try to run **mvn compile** everything should work
- you can run the program using intellij using the run command
- on a seperate terminal run **ngrok http 8080**

Now everything should work, look [here](https://github.com/KTH-DD2480/smallest-java-ci/blob/master/README.md) for more details on setting up the server with webhooks
