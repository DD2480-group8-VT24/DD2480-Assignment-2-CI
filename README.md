# how to run the server
- make sure to have java openjdk 21 installed, since that is the java version used for the project
- make sure you have installed ngrok and set it up on your machine, use following [link](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/)
- make sure you have installed latest version of maven, you can use the following [link](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- make sure to create a GitHub fine-grain [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) for the [repo](https://github.com/DD2480-group8-VT24/DD2480-Assignment-2-C) with only permission for "Read and Write access to commit statuses" and "Read access to metadata". Place the token in a file named githubPAT in the root folder of the project. This is required for status updates.
- Strongly advise to use intellij idea as the your IDE since that makes everything easier.
  
- clone the repo and make sure you are inside the CI subfolder
- now try to run **mvn compile** everything should work
- you can run the program using intellij using the run command
- on a seperate terminal run **ngrok http 8080**

Now everything should work, look [here](https://github.com/KTH-DD2480/smallest-java-ci/blob/master/README.md) for more details on setting up the server with webhooks

## CI feature #2 - testing

### Implementation
To test the program, the code calls maven with the ProcessBuilder class. The function then takes as input parameter the specific test case, a specific test class or - if the input is empty - will run all tests. The code then returns the boolean evaluation of said test, or will throw an exception if the test fails. 

### Testing
The testing process of this function is done with the aide of dummy tests. One test asserts to true, another will always be false. We then run the test function with these two test cases as input, therefore confirming if the first test is true and the second one is false.

## CI feature #3 - notification

### Implementation

The status notification ([found in StatusNotification](src/main/java/group8/StatusNotification.java)) is implemented using curl POST request which is executed by java RunTime. 

The request consists of: 
- The API path consisting of the repo, the owner and the full 40 character SHA. 
- A GitHub PAT for authentication. 
- A JSON object body with a state, target_url, description, and context field. This message is in turn generated by the createStatusMessage function, which takes in the outcome of the compilation and test suit.

### Testing
The test suit for createStatusMessage consists of assuring that the content of the JSON message is correct for the combinations: both compilation and tests passes, compilation passes and tests fails and compilation fails.

The test suit for statusNotification consists of a check that the GitHub PAT exists, as well as that a succesfull commit returns success, a failing commit returns failure and that an incorrect PATH (incorrect SHA) results in state not being found.
